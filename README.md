# LyricController
-Controller for Chyron Lyric using Telnet

-This is under quasi development.  I work on it when I can.  This is to replace a
controller which is currently in use on a Chyron Duet and was written in vb.net.

-This is in C# and feel free to fork or contact me pull requests.

-All helpers wanted.

###BACKGROUND
- I currently use the old controller to do some local football games.  The application
controls the graphics via the telnet interface on a Chyron Duet.

-This should be able to be ported to something that an Avid Deko could understand.
